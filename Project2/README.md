# Spark Structured Streaming

This project represents the implementation of a system for data flow processing in real time (Real-time Stream Processing). The focus is on the analysis of flight delay data using **Apache Kafka** as a message broker and **Apache Spark Structured Streaming** as the main processing framework. The final results are stored in the **Cassandra** NoSQL database.
